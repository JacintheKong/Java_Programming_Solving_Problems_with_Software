## Notes
All samples of code had been writing and tested in BlueJ IDE. For Duke's courses recommended using [a custom version of BlueJ](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2). 
Each sample of source code contains a main method with calls test methods.
Some code use extra packages, these packages are included by default in Duke's custom version of BlueJ:
